With extensive experience developing analytical tools and sensors for pharmaceutical development and bioprocess monitoring, I’ve seen firsthand how data can transform the life sciences. But raw data alone isn’t enough—it’s the ability to turn it into actionable insights that drives real progress.

I’m passionate about developing data processing algorithms and statistical methods that extract valuable insights from overlooked datasets. Highly adaptable, I excel at aligning technical innovations with commercial opportunities, helping companies grow, innovate, and make smarter decisions.

Key expertise in life sciences and data analysis includes:

📈 **Automated Data Analysis** – Developed pre-processing tools and regression analysis to refine noisy mass spectrometry data, advancing closed-loop bioprocessing.

📊 **Bayesian & Traditional Deconvolution Methods** – Created innovative analytical techniques for complex biopharmaceuticals, leading to valuable intellectual property.

🧪 **Technical leadership in bioprocess monitoring** – Led the development of a cost-effective, fully automated 14-day upstream bioprocess monitoring system.

🤝 **Collaboration in cross-functional engineering projects:** – Spearheaded the technical development of a novel antibody manufacturing monitoring product, coordinating efforts across internal and third-party engineering teams.
