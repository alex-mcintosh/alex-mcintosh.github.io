## Introduction

This is an implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life using R and Plotly.
This was an exercise in using R, Plotly and Shiny for implementing the
Game of Life. The implementation of the game can be found at:
<https://xcstat99.shinyapps.io/Game_of_Life/>. More information can 
also be found here: <https://github.com/alex-mcintosh/Game-of-Life>

## Background

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a
zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game
of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor
or any other Turing machine.
