## Introduction

The Study Group offers educational services, focusing on online courses, tutoring, and consulting. It partners with universities to attract international students and prepares them through International Study Centres, enhancing academic readiness and diversity. High student dropout rates can lead to significant revenue loss, diminished institutional reputation, and lower overall student satisfaction. This project aims to model student dropout using various supervised learning approaches.
