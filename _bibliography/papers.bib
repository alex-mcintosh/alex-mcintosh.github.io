  abstract={We report the first use of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to study the hydration and crystallization of an amorphous molecular solid at high humidity. Lactose in its amorphous and monohydrate forms exhibits different terahertz spectra due to the lack of long range order in the amorphous material. This difference allowed the transformation of amorphous lactose to its monohydrate form at high humidity to be studied in real time. Spectral fitting of frequency-domain data allowed kinetic data to be obtained and the crystallization was found to obey Avrami kinetics. Bulk changes during the crystallization could also be observed in the time-domain.}

  abstract={The adsorption rates onto a range of platinum single-crystal surfaces of key species involved in the proline-directed heterogeneous enantioselective hydrogenation of isophorone were investigated by electrochemical means. Specifically, the uptakes of the prochiral reactant (isophorone), the chiral hydrogenation product (3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone), and the chiral directing agent ((R)- and (S)-proline) were examined. The effects of R,S chiral kink sites on the adsorption of (R,S)-proline were also studied. The reactant adsorbs ∼105 times faster than the chiral modifier so that under conditions of competitive adsorption the latter is entirely excluded from the metal surface. Supplementary displacement and reaction rate measurements carried out with practical Pd/carbon catalysts show that under certain reaction conditions isophorone quickly displaces preadsorbed proline from the metal surface. Thus both kinetics and thermodynamics ensure that the chiral modifier can play no role in any surface-mediated process that leads to enantiodifferentiation. These results are fully consistent with the recent proposal1 that the crucial step leading to enantiodifferentiation occurs in the solution phase and not at the metal surface. In addition, it is found that there is no preferred diastereomeric interaction between (R,S)-proline and R,S step kink sites on Pt{643} and Pt{976}, implying that such sites do not play a role in determining the catalytic behavior of supported metal nanoparticles.}

  abstract={We have studied the proline-directed, Pd-catalyzed enantioselective hydrogenation of isophorone in the liquid state using a variety of methods. Our results unambiguously reveal the true reaction pathway and demonstrate that all earlier mechanistic hypotheses are wrong:  although a proline/isophorone condensation product is formed, it is merely a spectator and not a key reaction intermediate in subsequent heterogeneous hydrogenation. Enantioselectivity is the result of kinetic resolutiona process that occurs homogeneously in solution and not at the metal surface. Racemic 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (TMCH) is produced by initial heterogeneous hydrogenation of isophorone; proline then reacts homogeneously, preferentially with one enantiomer of TMCH, leaving an excess of the other. Thus in complete contrast to the case of ketoester asymmetric hydrogenation, the metal surface is not involved in the crucial enantio-differentiation step. The mechanism we propose also explains why the maximum attainable yield of enantiopure TMCH cannot exceed 50%.}
